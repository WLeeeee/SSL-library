# SSL-library
Personal implementation of SSL library in C.

This is a tiny version of SSL3.1 with basic handshake

and encryption capability. Some features are not implemented,

so they are supported by openssl right now.

See the source code for more information, which is under src/.

Documentation will be released soon.

There is also a tiny httpd implementation under exp/myhttp.

The httpd uses SSL library for file transmission.
